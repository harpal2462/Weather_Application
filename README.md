This project is a simple weather app that displays the current weather conditions for a given city.<br>

The app has the following features:<br>

An input field where the user can enter the name of a city.
A "Search" button to initiate the weather retrieval.<br>
Display of the city name, current temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).<br>
Integration with a weather API to fetch weather data based on the user's city input.<br>
Handling of error cases gracefully, such as displaying an error message if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.<br>
Basic styling to make the weather information visually appealing.<br>
A feature to toggle between displaying temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit.<br>

Bonus features:<br>
To use the app, simply enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Search" button. The app will then fetch the weather data for the city and display it on the screen.
