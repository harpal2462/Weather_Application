This project is a simple weather app that displays the current weather conditions for a given city.

The app has the following features:

An input field where the user can enter the name of a city.
A "Search" button to initiate the weather retrieval.
Display of the city name, current temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Integration with a weather API to fetch weather data based on the user's city input.
Handling of error cases gracefully, such as displaying an error message if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.
Basic styling to make the weather information visually appealing.
A feature to toggle between displaying temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Bonus features:
To use the app, simply enter the name of a city in the input field and click the "Search" button. The app will then fetch the weather data for the city and display it on the screen.
